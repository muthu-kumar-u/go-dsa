# Go - DSA Implementations

This repository is a personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations in **Go (Golang)**.  
The purpose of this repo is to **learn, practice, and experiment** with DSA concepts while improving my Go programming skills.

---

## Notes

- Each implementation will be kept simple and beginner-friendly.

- Code will be written with an emphasis on readability and understanding, not just optimization.

- Test cases may be added for better practice.

## Learning Journey

- This repo also serves as a prenote for my DSA learning in Go.
- Expect frequent updates as I go through different topics and improve the implementations.
