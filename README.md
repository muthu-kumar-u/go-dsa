# Go - Data Structures & Algorithm

A collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations in **Go**.  
This is my personal journey to learn and practice DSA daily, covering core concepts from basics to advanced.

---

## Features

- Implementations of common **data structures**: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, trees, graphs.
- **Algorithms**: searching, sorting, recursion, binary search, dynamic programming, etc.
- Written in **Go (Golang)** with clean, modular code.
- Each topic contains **examples and test cases**.
